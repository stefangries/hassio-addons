## About

Portainer is an open-source lightweight management UI which allows you to
easily manage a Docker host(s) or Docker swarm clusters.

It has never been so easy to manage Docker. Portainer provides a detailed
overview of Docker and allows you to manage containers, images, networks and
volumes.

with security in mind, in the wrong or inexperienced hands,
it could damage your system.

## Contributing
